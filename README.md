In this project, we first built five machine learning models: Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest Classifier, KNN, and Gaussian Naive Bayes, without considering the correlation with the target variable. This process was then repeated, but this time, correlation of every feature with the target was accounted for before building the models.
